          <h2> ~ The Sword ~</h2>
          <p>“Warp Riders is the third studio album by American heavy metal band the Sword. Recorded at Wire Recording in Austin, Texas with producer Matt Bayles, it was released by Kemado Records in August 2010.” – Wikipedia. Although a couple of great songs by The Sword had popped into my Spotify recommendations a few times before, I didn’t truly consider myself a fan until I saw them live a few weeks ago. My dad came to visit me in Austin, and I scoured the Austin Chronicle Calendar to find something fun to do. Of course, I came across a blurb written by Professor Hernandez. The Sword would be performing at the record store End of an Ear – and all you had to do to secure tickets was buy a copy of the re-released Warp Riders. Dad and I drove to End of an Ear for Record Store Day, did some shopping, and snagged ourselves some vinyls as well as two tickets to the intimate show! The group was absolutely locked-in rhythmically, making every riff hit with toughness and precision.</p>
