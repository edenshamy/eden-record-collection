          <h2> ~ Greta Van Fleet ~</h2>
          <p>“Starcatcher is the third studio album by American rock band Greta Van Fleet. It was released on July 21, 2023, through Lava and Republic Records. The album debuted at number 8 on the US Billboard 200 selling 46,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.” – Wikipedia. I had waited YEARS for this album to drop (ok, maybe like two years I guess since the release of The Battle at Garden’s Gate). On the eve of its release, I lit the Josh Kiszka candle that Ayesha bought me and prepared to be blown away. It did not disappoint! Although I do think the quality of the production on this album could have been better, I believe it has some of the best songs GVF has ever written. From “Sacred the Thread” to “The Indigo Streak” to “The Archer” and “Meeting the Master,” the grandiose and fantastical aura of this album is unlike any other.</p>
