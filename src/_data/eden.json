      "blurb": "Greta Van Fleet’s debut studio album dropped in October of 2018. I discovered the band a few months later. As an angsty teenager who listened to a lot of metal and rap, this hippie band brought me positive energy that I hadn’t experienced before from music. Although infused with some cheesy 60s/70s cliches, my 15-year-old self immediately fell in love with all the tunes on this album – and I still stand by that. My favorites include “Lover, Leaver (Taker, Believer),” “The New Day,” and “Mountain of the Sun.”"

Déjà Vu, is the second studio album by American folk rock group Crosby, Stills & Nash. The gorgeous, weathered cover opens up to an equally special inside-spread. This is one of my favorite albums, and certainly one of the best vinyls in my collection."

Josh Kizska’s vocals instantly entrapped me, like Robert Plant but with a grit and intonation unique to Kizska. This album released on November 10 (my birthday) of 2017. My favorite songs off this EP include “Flower Power,” “Talk on the Street,” and “Edge of Darkness,” all of which I learned to play on guitar in high school. I also love the cover of “Change is Gonna Come.”"

This is another gift from Professor Raoul Hernandez because I told him about my experience studying abroad in Ireland for a Maymester. The opening chants of Caislean Oir caught me by surprise and immediately captured me in the whimsical vibes of this experimental 80s album. My favorite songs off Macalla include “Closer to Your Heart” and “Journey’s End”."

I had waited YEARS for this album to drop (ok, maybe like two years I guess since the release of The Battle at Garden’s Gate). On the eve of its release, I lit the Josh Kiszka candle that Ayesha bought me and prepared to be blown away. It did not disappoint! Although I do think the quality of the production on this album could have been better, I believe it has some of the best songs GVF has ever written. From “Sacred the Thread” to “The Indigo Streak” to “The Archer” and “Meeting the Master,” the grandiose and fantastical aura of this album is unlike any other."

Although a couple of great songs by The Sword had popped into my Spotify recommendations a few times before, I didn’t truly consider myself a fan until I saw them live a few weeks ago. My dad came to visit me in Austin, and I scoured the Austin Chronicle Calendar to find something fun to do. Of course, I came across a blurb written by Professor Hernandez. The Sword would be performing at the record store End of an Ear – and all you had to do to secure tickets was buy a copy of the re-released Warp Riders. Dad and I drove to End of an Ear for Record Store Day, did some shopping, and snagged ourselves some vinyls as well as two tickets to the intimate show! The group was absolutely locked-in rhythmically, making every riff hit with toughness and precision."
