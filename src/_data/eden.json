It is their ninth album and is known for the duet between Clannad's singer Moya Brennan and U2 vocalist Bono on the single \"In a Lifetime\". This is another gift from Professor Raoul Hernandez because I told him about my experience studying abroad in Ireland for a Maymester. The opening chants of Caislean Oir caught me by surprise and immediately captured me in the whimsical vibes of this experimental 80s album. My favorite songs off Macalla include “Closer to Your Heart” and “Journey’s End”."
