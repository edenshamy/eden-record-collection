      <p>I'm Eden Shamy, and my record collection is small but eclectic. My teenage obsession with Greta Van Fleet is evident... yet I'm still missing their best album among my collection, The Battle at Gardens Gate. I also love all kinds of classic rock music, metal, folk and more. My dad got me into records, gifting me most of what I own alonside a Victrola for my high school graduation. Actually, I suppose most of these vinyls were gifts from family and friends!</p>
